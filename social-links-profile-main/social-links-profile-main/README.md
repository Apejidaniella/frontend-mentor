## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When working with links that navigate to another page, the best practice in semantic HTML is to use anchor (<a>) tags and style them to look like buttons. However, when submitting a form or triggering an action, buttons (<button>) should be used instead.

Also, inline elements do not support width, height, or vertical margins. I tried applying width, height, and margin to my <a> tags to space them out, but it didn’t work. So, I changed their display to block and set the width to 100%, which solved the spacing issue.
